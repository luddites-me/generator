## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-protect-integration using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g @ns8/generator-protect-integration
```

## Usage

Create a directory for your new integration

```bash
mkdir my-new-integration; cd my-new-integration/
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo @ns8/protect-integration
```

## Tests

Yeoman provides nice utilities for testing that the generator does what you expect.
See <https://yeoman.io/authoring/testing.html> and the `__tests__` directory.

## Running the generator

To run the generator locally (i.e., not as a global npm module), from the root of your generator project (in the generator-name/ folder), type:

```bash
npm link
```

That will install your project dependencies and symlink a global module to your local file. After npm is done, youâ€™ll be able to call yo name and you should see the this.log, defined earlier, rendered in the terminal. Congratulations, you just built your first generator!

## Changelog

**Developers**: for any breaking or backwards incompatible changes made to the generator, please record the version and one or more comments of what was changed into the [changelog.json](./changelog.json). Add in your version as another key under `releases` and enter your comments as an array of strings. E.g:

```json
"releases": {
  "0.0.13": [
    "Support for a changelog, the key is the version and the value is an array of strings indicating what has changed"
  ]
}
```
