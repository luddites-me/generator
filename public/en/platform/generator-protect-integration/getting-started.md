# Protect integration project generator

## Tests

Yeoman provides nice utilities for testing that the generator does what you expect.
See https://yeoman.io/authoring/testing.html and the `__tests__` directory.


## Running the generator

To run the generator locally (i.e., not as a global npm module), from the root of your generator project (in the generator-name/ folder), type:

```
npm link
```

That will install your project dependencies and symlink a global module to your local file. After npm is done, youâ€™ll be able to call yo name and you should see the this.log, defined earlier, rendered in the terminal. Congratulations, you just built your first generator!
